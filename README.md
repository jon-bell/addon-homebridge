# Home Assistant OS Add-on: Homebridge

This add-on provides the installation, configuration, and integration for
[Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge). All that it does is wrap the Homebridge docker image.

I made this to make it easier to integrate Homebridge plugins into Home Assistant. It's not a replacement for the Home Assistant HomeKit integration. You should *not* use this to expose Home Assistant devices to HomeKit. That's already supported by Home Assistant.
